📌 Introduction to Express.js

Express.js is a lightweight, flexible, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It is widely used for building RESTful APIs due to its simplicity and extensive middleware support.

> 🔧 Installation:



npm install express

✅ RESTful API Principles Overview

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style with the following core principles:

Principle	Description

Stateless	Each request contains all necessary information (no session state stored on server).
Client-Server	Separation between client UI and server logic.
Uniform Interface	Consistent and standard API endpoints.
Resource-Based	Everything is treated as a resource (users, posts, etc.).
Use of HTTP Methods	Use HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) appropriately.
Structured URIs	Clean, meaningful endpoints like /api/users/:id.

✅ Express.js: REST API Example (Simple)

Here’s a basic example of a RESTful API for managing students:

// server.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.json());

let students = [
  { id: 1, name: "Amina", age: 20 },
  { id: 2, name: "John", age: 22 },
];

// GET all students
app.get('/api/students', (req, res) => {
  res.json(students);
});

// GET a single student
app.get('/api/students/:id', (req, res) => {
  const student = students.find(s => s.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
  if (!student) return res.status(404).send('Student not found');
  res.json(student);
});

// POST (create) a new student
app.post('/api/students', (req, res) => {
  const newStudent = {
    id: students.length + 1,
    name: req.body.name,
    age: req.body.age
  };
  students.push(newStudent);
  res.status(201).json(newStudent);
});

// PUT (update) a student
app.put('/api/students/:id', (req, res) => {
  const student = students.find(s => s.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
  if (!student) return res.status(404).send('Student not found');

  student.name = req.body.name;
  student.age = req.body.age;
  res.json(student);
});

// DELETE a student
app.delete('/api/students/:id', (req, res) => {
  students = students.filter(s => s.id !== parseInt(req.params.id));
  res.status(204).send(); // No content
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});

✅ RESTful Principles Applied

REST Principle	Express Support	Evaluation

Stateless	✅ Yes, each request is self-contained	✔️ Good
Client-Server	✅ Full separation supported	✔️ Good
Uniform Interface	✅ Consistent endpoints like /students/:id	✔️ Good
Resource-Based	✅ Each entity (student) is a resource	✔️ Good
HTTP Verbs	✅ Uses GET, POST, PUT, DELETE correctly	✔️ Good
URI Design	✅ Clean and intuitive routes	✔️ Good

🟢 Advantages of Express.js for REST APIs

✅ Simple and fast to set up

✅ Middleware support (e.g., for auth, logging)

✅ Easy to structure into controllers/routes

✅ Works well with MongoDB, MySQL, etc.

✅ Huge community and mature ecosystem

🔴 Limitations & Considerations

Issue	Consideration

No built-in validation	Use packages like joi, express-validator
Not opinionated	Good for flexibility, but large apps need manual structure
No built-in rate limiting or security	Use middleware like helmet, cors, express-rate-limit



---

🧠 Conclusion

Creating a REST API using Express.js is efficient, intuitive, and fully aligned with REST principles. It offers great control and simplicity for building scalable, RESTful web services.

> 🔁 For more complex apps:

Use routing modules for separation

Add validation, authentication, and error handling

Combine with MongoDB (Mongoose) or SQL (Sequelize)
